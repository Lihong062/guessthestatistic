# Guess the Statistic

A modern, interactive web platform for testing and improving your statistical intuition through various guessing games. The platform is designed to be both educational and entertaining, helping users develop better understanding of data patterns and relationships.

## üéØ About the Project

This platform was inspired by the original "Guess the Correlation" game and expands on the concept to include multiple types of statistical guessing challenges. Each game focuses on different aspects of data interpretation, making learning statistics fun and engaging.

### Research Purpose

While the games are designed to be entertaining, they also serve a research purpose. Data on user guesses is collected to analyze how humans perceive correlations and other statistical relationships in data visualizations. The more people play, the more valuable data is generated for research on human statistical intuition.

## üéÆ Available Games

### 1. Guess the Correlation ‚úÖ (Available Now)
- **Description**: Look at scatter plots and guess the correlation coefficient between variables
- **Range**: 0 (no correlation) to 1 (perfect correlation)
- **Scoring**:
  - Within 0.05 of true correlation: +1 life, +5 coins
  - Within 0.10 of true correlation: +1 coin
  - More than 0.10 off: -1 life



## üöÄ Features

- **Modern, Responsive Design**: Beautiful UI that works on all devices
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time scatter plots using Chart.js
- **Progressive Scoring System**: Earn coins and lives based on accuracy
- **Streak Tracking**: Track your best consecutive correct guesses
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Monitor your performance over time
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for accessibility
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging visual feedback and transitions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Charts**: Chart.js for data visualization
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design principles
- **Icons**: Font Awesome for consistent iconography
- **Fonts**: Inter font family for optimal readability

3. Start playing!

### Local Development
If you want to run this locally for development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd guessthestatistic

# Open in your preferred code editor
code .

# Start a local server (optional, for development)
# Using Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed):
npx http-server

# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## üéØ How to Play

### Getting Started
1. Visit the main page and choose a game
2. Read the instructions carefully
3. Make your guess using the provided interface
4. Submit your answer and see how close you were
5. Continue playing to improve your skills!

### Tips for Success
- **Start with Correlation**: This is the most intuitive game to begin with
- **Look for Patterns**: Pay attention to the overall shape and direction of data
- **Practice Regularly**: Statistical intuition improves with practice
- **Don't Rush**: Take your time to analyze the visualizations

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Games
To add a new guessing game:

1. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `percentage-game.html`)
2. Add corresponding CSS and JavaScript files
3. Update the main `index.html` to include the new game card
4. Implement the game logic following the existing pattern

### Styling Customization
The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Key colors can be modified in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #667eea;
  --secondary-color: #764ba2;
  --accent-color: #ffd700;
  --text-color: #333;
  --background-color: #f8f9fa;
}
```
